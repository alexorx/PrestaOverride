Are you using PrestaShop?

If you need to show the "manufacturer_name" in every product inside your packed product this class can help

Now you can use {$manufacturer_name} inside your tpl file.

Override class Pack.php

Installation:
download the file classes/Pack.php
move the file in <PrestaShop root>/override/classes
remove (or rename) the file <PrestaShop root>/cache/class_index.php
Reload your home page

Enjoy.
